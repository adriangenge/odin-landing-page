							<h1>Clinical Guidance Document</h1>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/clinical-guidance-header.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project Description</h2>
							<p>This document was created to provide evidence-based guidance for clinics across Canada for when they commenced new treatment programs at their organisation. The original draft of the document was created collaboratively by healthcare leaders, clinicians, researchers, and patients. The draft was then sent to me to edit, refine, add missing content, organise layout, and draft design. During this process, I collaborated with subject matter experts (clinicians, researchers, and patients) to verify that all content was accurate and in a satisfactory format. The final design of the document was created by our organisationâ€™s communication department and distributed to healthcare leaders across Canada.</p>
