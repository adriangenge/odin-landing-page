							<h2>Project Description</h2>
							<p>This research manual was created to provide a comprehensive guide for a 1+ year long research project. It provided research staff with procedures and guidelines to be followed throughout the project. The manual was developed in collaboration with the principal investigator of the project, research managers, and staff, to ensure that it covered all subjects related to the research. Some of the sections include step-by-step procedures for navigating software, guides for recruiting research participants, safety procedures for the research site, and reccomendations for cultural safety and trauma informed practices. The manual is presented here as a help system and which was built using MadCap Flare.</p>
